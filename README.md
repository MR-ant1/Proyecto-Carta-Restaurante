<h1>La Vuelta al Mundo Menu</h1>
Welcome to my first project in git! this one is an basic one for the moment where i'm testing my skills in programming while I learn both lenguajes mentioned down here

<h3>POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS</h3> :heavy_check_mark:

• <strong> Add a reservation form:</strong> the next step for a menu like this in a official website would be to have the possibility to implement this function to give the customer the maximal opportunities to try the restaurant
•<strong> Suggestion form:</strong> It would be interesting to give the possibility to the customers to purpose new meals from any other countries
• <strong>Reviews:</strong> Showing past customers opinions, may atract other ones to the business

<h3>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h3> :raised_hands:

Big shout out to GeeksHubs for giving me the chance to learn about all this amazing world of "programming" (If that word is allowed at this point)
More and better proyects are coming nearly thanks to them!
