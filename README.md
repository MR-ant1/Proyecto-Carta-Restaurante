###POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS :heavy_check_mark:

• <strong> Add a reservation form:</strong> the next step for a menu like this in a official website would be to have the possibility to implement this function to give the customer the maximal opportunities to try the restaurant
•<strong> Suggestion form:</strong> It would be interesting to give the possibility to the customers to purpose new meals from any other countries
• <strong>Reviews:</strong> Showing past customers opinions, may atract other ones to the business
